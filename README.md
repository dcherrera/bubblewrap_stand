In my old business I would purchase huge roles of bubble wrap from uline. I needed a way to hold the role on a dowel. I then hung it from a shelf. This is the file a came up with. I haven't touched it in a while but i believe I made it so you could fit a skateboard bearing in each side of it. This worked very well for over 2 years for me.

If you find anything I produce useful. Consider sending some love in the form of cash or crypto.
